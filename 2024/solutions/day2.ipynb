    "We are tasked with analyzing lines individually. Each line should be monotonic and adjacent numbers can differ by at most 3. We need to count the number of rows that meet such conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We can scan through and complete these checks in one pass by seeing whether the levels increase or decrease between first and second element AND whether the difference is at most 3 for all remaining elements. This will scan all the elements in quadratic time, which is the best possible. This might be done with vectorized operations at the cost of some memory by making extra arrays with size len(report) + 1. Padding out the array like this enables us to offset and calculate the differences and use a numpy mask to evaluate whether the values of that difference fall into the conditional, for instance np.any(np.where(0 >= diffs > 3, \"Safe\", \"Unsafe\") == \"Unsafe\"). However, because each report is small, it's not worth the overhead cost."
